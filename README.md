# Family Credit Card Spend Tracker

This project is a mobile-first application to track and analyze monthly credit card spending for family members. It uses a Flask backend with an Angular frontend. Transactions are parsed from uploaded PDF statements and organized with tags for flexible reporting.

## Development Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python backend/run.py
   ```

This repository contains an initial backend skeleton. Frontend code can be added under the `frontend/` directory following the structure in `AGENTS.md`.
